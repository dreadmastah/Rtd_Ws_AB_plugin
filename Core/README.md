# Core auto-trader scaffold - simulation only

This subtree is the first bounded attachment between the existing CleanRoomR2 WSRTD data path and the Architecture R3.1 trading-engine shape.

## Safety boundary

This code cannot submit an exchange order. It contains no Binance private API client, no credentials, no signing, and no production/Testnet routing. The terminal simulated path is `OrderRoutingDisabled`.

## Component map

- `common/` - bounded contracts shared by signal, data and execution simulation.
- `trade_plugin/` - `SignalIntentBuilder` scaffold for the future Trade.dll boundary.
- `wsrtd/` - adapter from observable R2 cache/freshness state to `DataStatus`.
- `execution/` - fail-closed intent validation, synthetic risk gate, synthetic sizing, and disabled order manager.
- `schemas/` - JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 contracts for `SignalIntent.v1` and `DataStatus.v1`.
- `tests/` - deterministic simulation-only checks.

## WSRTD R2 integration status

The R2 DLL ABI is left unchanged. A compatibility bridge now runs beside the existing WSRTD stack:

- `CleanRoomR2/stack/universe_identity.v1.json` is the tracked bootstrap-universe identity.
- `identity_bridge.py` verifies that manifest against the exact ordered `bootstrap_symbols.tls` SHA-256.
- It reads the already-persisted completed-1m recovery watermark for each symbol.
- It publishes `runtime/data_identity.v1.json` atomically.
- For this compatibility layer, `dataGeneration` is exactly the completed 1-minute open timestamp in milliseconds and is explicitly labelled `WSRTD_R2_COMPLETED_M1_OPEN_MS`.
- `SignalIntentBuilder.bind_data_identity()` copies the verified `universeId`, `universeVersion`, and `dataGeneration` into the intent.
- `IntentValidator` rejects universe-ID/version and generation mismatches.

If the manifest fails verification, a symbol has no completed-1m watermark, or the identity snapshot is unavailable, the adapter remains fail-closed with `IdentityUnavailable`.

This is a compatibility identity for the current R2 data path, not a claim that the existing DLL internally implements the later Architecture R3.1 publication-generation mechanism.

## Build and test

From an x64 Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt or another CMake C++20 environment:

```text
cmake -S Core -B build/core
cmake --build build/core --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/core -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Run the synthetic simulator:

```text
build/core/Release/astu_execution_sim.exe
```

The expected terminal message contains `SIMULATION_ONLY` and `order routing ... disabled`.

## Current next implementation step

The identity compatibility boundary is now defined. The next useful increment is the local Trade.dll/Execution.exe IPC simulation path: canonical serialization, bounded framing, request/response IDs, CRC/integrity validation, and duplicate/idempotency rejection while keeping order routing disabled.
